Dear TA's
UNDO FUNCTION: Trigger this function by entering -1! Each and every Command inputted by the user is stored in a command list. The Undo
 unction undoes the last command of this list and removes it from the list. Like this, each and every command ever
 committed by the user can be undone

TIME: Threads are used to monitor time. Each specific Thread is a child and inherits from MyThread

PATTERNS: The Command Pattern was implemented. We discussed about implementing the Singleton Pattern for Devices
but decided against it as it is uncertain if there are, for example, more than just 1 cleaning Robots per
household
