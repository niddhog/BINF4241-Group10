Dear TA's
We have completed the task. While we had to reshuffle some of our classes, we cannot delete the additional classes anymore. Could you 
please only not consider the following files:
CheckStatus.java
ChessBoard.java
ChessNotes.java
ChessPlayer.java
PlayerBoard.java
Result.java
dump.java
printStatus.java

The main() file is ChessGame, required files integrated and should work.
